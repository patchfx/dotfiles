# Richard's Dotfiles

Managed using [thoughtbot][1]'s [rcm][2].

## Requirements

Uses `zsh`

You will need to install [rcm][2]. If you are using a mac with homebrew you
should be able to run:

```sh
brew bundle
```

Next do the initial link of the dotfiles.

```sh
rcup -d dotfiles -x README.md -x Brewfile
```
